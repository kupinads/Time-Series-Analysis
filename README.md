Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis
Project Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate time series forecasting models to predict monthly sales for 50 products across 10 stores. The dataset consists of 5 years of historical sales data, with the goal of identifying the most accurate models to inform future sales strategies.

Objectives
To analyze historical sales data and uncover patterns such as seasonality and trends.
To categorize items and stores based on sales performance (high, medium, low).
To fit and compare multiple time series models for each category to determine the best-performing model.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Normalize the data to improve model performance.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
Categorization:

Group items and stores into categories based on their sales performance.
Modeling:

Train and evaluate multiple models (2-3 per category) using techniques such as:
ARIMA
Exponential Smoothing
XGBoost
RNN Models
Prophet
Naive Seasonal and Naive Drift
Evaluation:

Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and visualizations to ensure alignment with historical trends.
Select the best-performing model for each group based on evaluation results.
